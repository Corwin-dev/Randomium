Randomium is a simple mod that adds a new Randomium ore.

You'll be able to find it pretty much everywhere in the overworld and upon broken it will drop a random minecraft item or, if you are lucky, you'll get the chance to get a Randomium crystal.
Randomium is an unstable element and when broken, with a diamond pick or above, will morph into a random minecraft item.
If you are lucky (literally) you will also be able to find randomium crystals.
These are extremely rare items that haven't morphed into loot yet and instead allow the player to choose what item to morph them in.
To do so simply craft them in a crafting table with any item of your choice.

The mod can be configured via the provided configs and tags
